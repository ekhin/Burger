# Burger

## Description

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

The application is implemented using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, ORM, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [body-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser), [path](https://www.npmjs.com/package/path), [Express](https://expressjs.com/) server on the back end, and the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) CSS framework on the front end.
